title: It's Been A While
---

Quite a bit of time has passed since I last wrote a blog post, so I figured I'd write a quick little update about what's been going on with me, why I haven't been posting, and why the [Projects](http://touchred.github.io/projects.html) page is still empty (it isn't if you're reading this after July of 2014). All of these subjects sort of go together, so I'll just address them all. 

Right now I'm out of school for the Summer, and I'll be going back August 4th. I've been trying to take advantage of this time and work on some projects, and I think I've been doing sort of well. I just got back from [HackDecatur](http://touchred.github.io/hackdecatur/), a hackathon that I organized to help the city of Decatur, GA become more technologically oriented. Although I only had around 8 people show up, they were all really cool people that were awesome to work with. I'd say it was a success, and I'll definitely be planning more events in the future. 
I don't have too many pictures, as I was focused on the [app we were working on](http://github.com/HackDecatur2014/lflab). This is all I've got:

Sorry. I'll take more pictures next time. Notice how I have StackOverflow open behind Terminal. Telling, isn't it?

Organizing HackDecatur took an enormous amount of effort; way more than I expected. But I'm glad that I can finally say that I organized a hackathon, and I think I learned a lot from the experience. However, it is the prime reason why I haven't been working on other stuff too much. Between that and my job, I haven't had a whole lot of time to write code worth showing. I've been learning a lot though, so now that I have time I will definitely try to push out some more projects. 

I've been learning [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) and playing around with the Google Maps API, so you can expect something of that nature to be released soon. I also got to tinker with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) a little bit at HackDecatur, and I was super intrigued by that. Finally, Node is slick. That's all I'll say.

**Also, update: ThirtyWeeks never happened. It might happen soon. I don't know. Stay frosty.**
