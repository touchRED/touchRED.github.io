<p>I&#8217;ve been coding as a hobby for awhile now, but I&#8217;m really starting to get more serious about it. It&#8217;s one of the main things I think about, and I&#8217;m constantly coming up with new ideas that I want to implement.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;m finding that many techniques I use when I code aren&#8217;t entirely sound. I&#8217;ve been coming up with lots of ideas, but I&#8217;m not sure how to implement them because I have such a bare-bones, self-taught programming education. So I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I&#8217;ve been researching certain books I can read or courses I can take to give myself the programming foundations knowledge that I need.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;ve come to a decent conclusion.</p>

<p><strong>While books and courses can help to some degree, only practical application will truly push me along as a programmer.</strong></p>

<p>What I&#8217;ve been learning is that you can only get better at coding by <em>actually</em> coding. Now, it doesn&#8217;t take much common sense to understand that if one continues to do something, he/she will naturally develop a certain degree of talent for it. But I think it goes deeper than that. Programming languages, just like any other languages, require practice. If a Spanish student speaks the language on a regular basis, their mind may accomodate, and they may find it easier to speak Spanish over time. Similarly, if I continue to program over an extended period of time, my grasp of the particular language I&#8217;m working with will increase exponentially.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve chosen to start a sort of &#8220;regimen&#8221; where I will program one project to completion each week for thirty weeks. This is more of a test length than anything; if thirty weeks works well, I will probably continue for longer.</p>

<p>In order to track my progress, I&#8217;ve set up a <a href='https://github.com/touchRED/Thirty_Weeks'>github repo</a> that will hold the source code and descriptions for each of my projects. If I feel like I&#8217;ve learned something significant with a certain project, I might even write a blog post about it.</p>

<p>The point of this idea isn&#8217;t to bust out thirty top-notch projects in a short amount of time. The point is to craft my ideas, code them, and become a better programmer in the process. I&#8217;m confident I will have an entirely new skill set by the end of the coming thirty weeks.</p>
