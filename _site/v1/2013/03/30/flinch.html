<p>So I&#8217;ve been reading Julian Smith&#8217;s <em>The Flinch</em> lately, which is all about humans overcoming their instinctual fears, which aren&#8217;t necessary in today&#8217;s world. For example, we as humans have no reason to fear a cold shower, but we do anyway. This is because when we were less well-off as a race, we associated cold with hypothermia, and hypothermia with death. As we have evolved and grown to be more self-sufficient beings, we have lost all need for this fear of the cold. We hesitate, or <em>flinch</em> as Smith would say, whenever we are forced to go out into cold weather, or hop into a cold shower.</p>

<p>This was actually one of the exercises in the book: to turn your shower to its coldest temperature, and hop in. The goal is to experience this flinch, and overcome it in a controlled environment. Smith claims that if you can overcome the flinch in a controlled environment such as this, you&#8217;ll be more likely to overcome it in the future, no matter the circumstances.</p>

<p>While jumping into a freezing cold shower this weekend definitely isn&#8217;t my idea of <strong>fun</strong>, it helped me realize how much humanity depends on controlled surroundings. We&#8217;ve become so accustomed to waking up, going to work/school, and coming home, only to resume the same cycle the next day. After completing so many iterations of this cycle, we&#8217;ve rubbed away all the &#8220;sharp corners&#8221; that might hurt us in our everyday grind. To put it simply, we get stuck in a cushiony rut.</p>

<p>If we can learn to apply our strategies of overcoming the <em>flinch</em> in our showers, then perhaps we can learn to apply it in our daily routine as well.</p>

<p>Have a flinch free day.</p>
