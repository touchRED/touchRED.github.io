<div id = "about">
<p>I'm a creator. It's as simple as that. 
        I'm currently in high school, dreaming of becoming an interactive developer and influencing the world someday. 
        If you feel the same way, I think you're pretty cool. </p>
<p>
	This is where I post mainly about code, mathematics, and physics. I'm also an avid filmmaker, so news about that may sneak its way in here as well.
