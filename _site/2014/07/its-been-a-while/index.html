		<h1>It's Been A While</h1>
		<p>Quite a bit of time has passed since I last wrote a blog post, so I figured I&#8217;d write a quick little update about what&#8217;s been going on with me, why I haven&#8217;t been posting, and why the <a href='http://touchred.github.io/projects.html'>Projects</a> page is still empty (it isn&#8217;t if you&#8217;re reading this after July of 2014). All of these subjects sort of go together, so I&#8217;ll just address them all.</p>

<p>Right now I&#8217;m out of school for the Summer, and I&#8217;ll be going back August 4th. I&#8217;ve been trying to take advantage of this time and work on some projects, and I think I&#8217;ve been doing sort of well. I just got back from <a href='http://touchred.github.io/hackdecatur/'>HackDecatur</a>, a hackathon that I organized to help the city of Decatur, GA become more technologically oriented. Although I only had around 8 people show up, they were all really cool people that were awesome to work with. I&#8217;d say it was a success, and I&#8217;ll definitely be planning more events in the future. I don&#8217;t have too many pictures, as I was focused on the <a href='http://github.com/HackDecatur2014/lflab'>app we were working on</a>. This is all I&#8217;ve got:</p>

<p><img alt='Wow' src='http://i.imgur.com/W512gex.png' /></p>

<p>Sorry. I&#8217;ll take more pictures next time. Notice how I have StackOverflow open behind Terminal. Telling, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Organizing HackDecatur took an enormous amount of effort; way more than I expected. But I&#8217;m glad that I can finally say that I organized a hackathon, and I think I learned a lot from the experience. However, it is the prime reason why I haven&#8217;t been working on other stuff too much. Between that and my job, I haven&#8217;t had a whole lot of time to write code worth showing. I&#8217;ve been learning a lot though, so now that I have time I will definitely try to push out some more projects.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been learning <a href='https://angularjs.org/'>Angular</a> and playing around with the Google Maps API, so you can expect something of that nature to be released soon. I also got to tinker with <a href='https://www.meteor.com'>Meteor</a> a little bit at HackDecatur, and I was super intrigued by that. Finally, Node is slick. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll say.</p>

<p><strong>Also, update: ThirtyWeeks never happened. It might happen soon. I don&#8217;t know. Stay frosty.</strong></p>
