I've been coding as a hobby for awhile now, but I'm really starting to get more serious about it. It's one of the main things I think about, and I'm constantly coming up with new ideas that I want to implement. 

Unfortunately, I'm finding that many techniques I use when I code aren't entirely sound. I've been coming up with lots of ideas, but I'm not sure how to implement them because I have such a bare-bones, self-taught programming education. So I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I've been researching certain books I can read or courses I can take to give myself the programming foundations knowledge that I need.  

I think I've come to a decent conclusion. 

**While books and courses can help to some degree, only practical application will truly push me along as a programmer.**

What I've been learning is that you can only get better at coding by *actually* coding. Now, it doesn't take much common sense to understand that if one continues to do something, he/she will naturally develop a certain degree of talent for it. But I think it goes deeper than that. Programming languages, just like any other languages, require practice. If a Spanish student speaks the language on a regular basis, their mind may accomodate, and they may find it easier to speak Spanish over time. Similarly, if I continue to program over an extended period of time, my grasp of the particular language I'm working with will increase exponentially. 

I've chosen to start a sort of "regimen" where I will program one project to completion each week for thirty weeks. This is more of a test length than anything; if thirty weeks works well, I will probably continue for longer. 

In order to track my progress, I've set up a [github repo](https://github.com/touchRED/Thirty_Weeks) that will hold the source code and descriptions for each of my projects. If I feel like I've learned something significant with a certain project, I might even write a blog post about it.

The point of this idea isn't to bust out thirty top-notch projects in a short amount of time. The point is to craft my ideas, code them, and become a better programmer in the process. I'm confident I will have an entirely new skill set by the end of the coming thirty weeks.
