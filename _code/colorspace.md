# COLOR_SPACE_ - [web](https://e-m-r.github.io/COLOR_SPACE_/), [code](https://github.com/e-m-r/COLOR_SPACE_)


I created this tool as a primer for explaining how color can be represented spatially. This started out as an example for group members in my class, but I realized afterwards that this process can actually lead to some pretty interesting compositions.

What I like about working with this tool is that it produces forms whose colors are inextricably tied to their points in space. You can't have a specific shade of blue in more than one point, and that point may not be where you want it to be. Since color isn't under the artist's control, this design system encourages us to compose images around spatial concepts (curves, grids, etc.), leaving color as an afterthought.

All in all, I mean for this to be a playful exploration of color, space, and how the two relate.
