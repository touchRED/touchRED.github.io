# AR Experiments - [code](https://github.com/touchRED/ar-experiments)

I recently started investigating augmented reality design thanks to a new [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) addon, [ofxARKit](https://github.com/sortofsleepy/ofxARKit).

This repository is still very much in its early stages, but it's growing every day as I learn something new. Normally I wouldn't be too inclined to show something this rough, but I think it's important to document my use of this technology since there aren't really any educational resources yet.

If you have any questions about AR, openFrameworks, or using ofxARKit, [please reach out](mailto:mail@ctrotter.co).
