# Hyponym Garden â€“ [web](http://ctrotter.co/hyponym-garden/), [code](https://github.com/touchRED/hyponym-garden)

This was my final project for [Mark Callahan's](http://mazamedia.com/) ARST 3860 Net Art course. It uses the [Wordnik](https://www.wordnik.com/) and [Giphy](https://giphy.com/) APIs to let the user wander through imagery connected to language.

Pressing the right/left arrow keys moves you forward/backward along synonyms, pressing the up arrow moves you up to a "hypernym" (a more general term), and pressing the down arrow takes you down to a "hyponym" (a more specific term).

Give it a go [here](http://ctrotter.co/hyponym-garden/).
