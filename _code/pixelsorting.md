# Pixel Sorting â€“ [web](http://ctrotter.co/pixelsorting-web/), [code](https://github.com/touchRED/pixelsorting)

I spent Summer 2017 as a Research Fellow at UGA's [Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities](http://curo.uga.edu/index.html), where I investigated different forms of computational creativity. Most of my research centered around creative applications of machine learning, but one of my first experiments had to do with pixel sorting: taking in an image as input, and outputting an image of the same size, with the pixels sorted.

I found this to be a great introductory method for design systems thinking, so I made a couple simple tools that allow people to use this method in other work. The first is a web tool, which you can find [here](http://ctrotter.co/pixelsorting-web/). The second is a native application built with [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/), which you can find [on github](https://github.com/touchRED/pixelsorting).

I'm presenting at the [CURO Symposium](http://curo.uga.edu/symposium/index.html) in April, but until then here's my [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h8gafvFUFiknPVE_Fg9cK57R3oBZyplId22bA5T9A1Q/edit?usp=sharing) from the Summer Research Forum, if that's something you're into.
