# Trio Gallery Installation

Last year, I got to set up my first interactive installation at the new [Trio Contemporary Art Gallery](https://www.trioathens.com/) in Athens. I was deep in my investigation of pixel sorting at the time, and I thought it could be really fun to drop people into the process and let them control the sorting themselves.

The installation is based around sorting the pixels of a 7,000 x 7,000 rendering of [Monet's "Woman with a Parasol"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_with_a_Parasol_-_Madame_Monet_and_Her_Son#/media/File:Claude_Monet_-_Woman_with_a_Parasol_-_Madame_Monet_and_Her_Son_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg). Viewers use their hands to travel through the painting in a 600px x 600px window, sorting everything in view. I used a Leap Motion hand sensor for the interaction, and hooked it up to an [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) app running the sorting process.

Here are some more pics, taken at the [Ideas for Creative Exploration](http://ideasforcreativeexploration.com/) studio:
