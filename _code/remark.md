# Remark – [link](http://ctrotter.co/remark/), [code](https://github.com/touchRED/remark)

A few of my friends love linguistics, so for UGA’s Simulations and Modeling course, I made a simple language evolution tool that models common phonological change. I recently redesigned it, and I hope to add more features in the future.

I also wrote an [essay](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LfJRIlZXBmoGWQnrlBd95aWq4pUlPBe6v0Li3Pp9H-A/edit?usp=sharing) on it, which you can read if you're into that.
